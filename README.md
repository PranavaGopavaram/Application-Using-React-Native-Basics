# 📱 Basic iOS App with React Native

Welcome to the repository for my latest project — a **basic iOS application built using React Native**! This app serves as a foundational template and learning project to understand and explore the power of React Native in building mobile applications.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the setup and development of a simple iOS mobile application using:

- **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development.
- **Expo** (optional, if used) for fast testing and development.
- **Xcode Simulator** for iOS testing.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React Native**
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** (if applicable)
- **Node.js**
- **Xcode** (iOS Simulator)
- **Expo CLI** (if used)

## 🧰 Features

- Clean and simple UI
- Basic navigation using React Navigation
- Custom components and reusable layouts
- State management using React Hooks
- Fully responsive on various iOS screen sizes
